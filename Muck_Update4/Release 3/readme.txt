/edit (number)

Originally a debug command used to help with the making of /recipe,
but then found out to work as a legitimate item swapper, see bottom of document for IDs
Write /edit, then a number separated by a space for the ID, if done correctly text will appear in chat.
Left click the item in the inventory to hold it and then place it back again, if done right the
description will say "HACKED".
Then to update the item so it behaves as usual, drop the item then pick it up again.
